	*all numbers will have be divisible by either prime numbers or products of the set of prime numbers it is divisible by: i.e. 28- 1,2,4,7,14,28- ( 4 is 2*2 and 14 is 7*2)

	generate sieve of prime numbers large enough to cover all cases (up to 2 million to start?)
	generate triangle numbers (maybe 100 at a time)

	//divisor algorithm possibrus!!
	mathy
	check is multiple of prime numbers less then half of triangle.

	//less mathy maybe faster
	generate 500 triangle numbers
	perform binary search checking numbers of divisors. find divisors using brute force 
	(primes method is iffy because if its even, you have to check all multiples of two, which only cuts down 50% of numbers! which by the time you generate primes doesn't cut down on run time very much. might as well check all possibly numbers less then number)
